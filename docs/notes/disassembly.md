# Disassembly Instructions

Whether you want to replace the unit, change a part, or reconfigure the scope structure, disassembly is required.

## Disassembling everything

This is easy. Remove all the components one by one. It helps to have the scope mounted on a breadboard.

## To unmount the whole scope without complete disassembly

1. Remove both the left–right bottom box panels.
2. Loosen the bottom M3 screws on the front and back panels so that the acrylic can bend slightly, allowing easier access to the M6 screws holding the scope. Small M3 Allen keys are useful, as the working space is limited.
3. Disconnect the camera cables using a small screwdriver to reach the clamps on both sides.
4. Gently pull the acrylic panels so they do not block the heads of the M6 screws, then loosen the M6 screws completely. Move diagonally to prevent stress accumulation on one side: bottom-left → top-right → bottom-right → top-left.

## Change configuration without unmounting

1. Remove the rod clamps.
2. Remove all the M3 screws that connect the box panels to the *Top Plate*.
3. Disconnecting the electronics is not strictly necessary, as the *Top Plate* can be removed while still connected to the LED and the temperature and humidity sensor.
4. Move the parts slowly without applying shear force. Use lubricant if necessary.
